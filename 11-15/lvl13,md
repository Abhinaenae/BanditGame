# Level 13 to 14

## Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.

## Solution
First, connect to bandit13 via `ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.

So far, we have logged onto a remote machine using `ssh` with a password. But, an alternative to using a password is public-key cryptography. The public key is on the remote host that allows access to the user who owns the private key. The `-i` flag allows you to log in with the private key.

`scp` is a command that uses SSH to transfer data over the network. The syntax to get a file from a remote host: scp -P <port> <user>@<IP>:<remotefilepath> <localfilepath>. 

I logged into the server as bandit13 and found 'sshkey.private' in home directory. We can transfer the file to local since we know the location.
